    <div class="title"> Welcome to our SANDHATA an Academy of Art... </div>
    <div class="content_text"> SANDHATA is an ingenious institution dedicated to Arts, starting its journey with a creative summer course on ‘Imaginative Art’ to reach close to the hearts of children. Here we provide guidance & assistance to children to co-ordinate their mind; eyes & hands simultaneously thereby improve their motor abilities. This course forms foundation to manifest their talent, skills and develop their self confidence. </div>
    <div class="content_text"> <img src="images/illustr2.jpg" width="130" height="79" alt="" class="pic" /> Every child is gift of God having the ability to do something special. When a little baby smiles at you, you feel proud and try to share this joy with others. This way the baby is recognised by you. For that recognition, the baby will try to repeat same thing several times. Small babies do many things to feel proud of, get attention from their parents, elders etc. By your encouragement , for your smiles, to make you proud the small child learns to crawl, learns to walk, speaks, learns poems, smiles, makes funny faces, even sometimes cries, falls down to get your attention. While learning many things (s) he will come across many pit falls. To stand on legs, (s) he falls down for 'n' number of times. They will take more than 11 months of continuous efforts after birth to stand on their legs. Every step is a great achievement to the child, parents, grand parents etc. You are the role-model for them because every day they observe you, whatever you do they try to repeat them, do many mistakes. By doing mistakes (s)he will learn many things , more than doing the right things every time. </div>

    <div class="content_text"> 
Today's education system is very competitive and one must strive not to commit mistakes. This needs the ability to think creatively and do things differently. There is little scope for many children in our country to get education which encompasses critical thinking, problem solving, decision making and creativity. An American psychologist in his research says that a child hears 1, 48,000 negative words by the time the child attains the age of 15. <br> Art is the panacea for a child's true creativity that paves a road to all success. Art is something where a child can feel, touch, is able to see what (s) he performed, get attention of him & others. He can measure himself, improves confidence level, gets mental stability, and makes him expressive. Art acts as a medium to the child & society so that the Childs transform himself or herself into a purposeful citizen of the country. </div>
